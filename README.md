# Woodworking
Spicing up the early game, without making it tedious

## Features

* Sticks are no longer craftable from planks, you get them from leaves and saplings.
* Mining stone drops rocks instead of cobble. In order to craft cobblestone, you'll need clay.
  * Andesite, Diorite and Granite drop rocks, too.
  * The corresponding blocks are crafted by surrounding a ball of clay with 8 rocks.
  * Any 4 will turn into gravel, which can be crafted again into 4 generic rocks. All the cobblestone!
* Mining iron/gold now drops ore rocks, which smelt for one nugget each.
* Tools and armor drop one of their crafting components.
  * Enchant tools with Scraping I/II/III to increase the chances it's the GOOD item.
  * Enchant armor with Scraping I/II/III to increase the chances it's two instead.
* Drying rack
  * Turn meat into jerky: not too nutritive, but highly saturating.
  * Turn leather (which really, should be called hide), into tanned leather, for improved armour.
* Craft chainmail pieces with iron nuggets in a diamond shape, then use these diamond pieces to craft chainmail armor!
* Torches can set mobs on fire, but they have a high chance of breaking in the process.
